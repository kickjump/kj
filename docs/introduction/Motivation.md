Technology is moving fast.

The JavaScript community is moving super fast.

As more developers come on board (they took our joobs!), and as JavaScript becomes ubiquitous the fight to build new frameworks, tools, best practices has heated up. For the average developer, it's impossible to keep up.

Fortunately for us, you're not the average developer. You're hopping on the gravy train and milking this JavaScript cash cow for all it's worth. Each new framework that gains steam presents a new opportunity. For a few months there's confusion, employers aren't sure if it's going to catch on. You don't care. You've got your lottery ticket in hand, dabbling in this and a few other potentially lucrative technologies.  You don't care to be the best in market. You just know that if this or any of your other gambles catch on, you're going to be a wanted developer! Kerching!

You'll confidently declare in interviews. I've been using this for X months. When really you completed a hello world application and realised you couldn't be bothered to dive further into the useless documentation.

It's a beautiful con.

`kj` aims to be the next in line of unneeded, but JavaScript job creating tools that promises you the world, until you attempt to use it in actual development, only to realise, to your horror, the true scale of it's shittiness.. The best thing is, unlike Facebook and Google, we don't have the legions of soulless developers, sacrificing themselves at the altar of compromised-values, to work for months toward something, that somewhat resembles, something, which, perhaps while squinting, you could poke a stick at...

Just make sure you really don't like the stick.

So if you're bleeding edge and *foolishly* willing to dangle your reputation on the line by using a library/framework (who cares!) created by some unknown company on the internet, then this is the tool for you. In fact we think it's pretty great.

## Official blurb

`kj` provides an insight into the latest and greatest tools for delivering multiplatform experiences to your users.

Whether you're looking to deploy exclusively on the web, or across mobile, tablets and desktop, this might be the tool for you.

Maybe for the new two weeks, until something fresher comes along.
